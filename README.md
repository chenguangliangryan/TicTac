# TicTac
TicTac-More Challenge, also called eight digital, or called the rearrangement of the nine house. Specifically, eight different pieces are placed on a 3*3 nine-place board, and a space is also allowed to allow a piece around the space to move toward the space, thus shifting from the given initial layout by moving the piece. The goal layout is a fun digital game.

The game refers to the Jiugongge design, but it is more appealing than the original Jiugongge. Changing eight pieces to a part of the entire picture is gradually increasing in difficulty.
